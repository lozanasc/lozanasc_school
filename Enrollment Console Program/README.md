A Terminal-based Enrollment Console Program
</h3>
A Terminal-based Enrollment Program that tries to mimic NORSU's current local Enrollment System.

## About the Program
As mentioned, the objective of this program is to mimic our University's Enrollment System that is implemented locally in the campus. It allows users and faculty to do the ff:  

#### Faculty
* Register
* Login
* Store/Create/Delete Course
* Approve/Deny Enrollee Application  

#### Student/Enrollee
* Enroll/Register
* Login
* Check Application Status
* Add Subjects

This program is probably not the best for beginners due to the nature of the code which is very toxic, however if you still want to learn it, you'll probably learn a thing or two about scoping, reusability, a sprinkle of OOP and data structures especially Linked Lists and its basic operations.

### Built with
This Terminal-based program is built with C++

## Getting Started
