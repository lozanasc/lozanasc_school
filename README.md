<!-- About this Branch -->
## About
As mentioned this branch contains all Console Programs that I deemed worthy of saving, I had tons of console programs I made back when I was a freshman but I think these programs are the only ones worth show casing.  
  
If you're browsing this branch there's a really good chance that you're a freshman looking for resources that you can learn from, this branch is a really good resource for learning the fundamentals of C++ and Java by creating real-world systems on the terminal.
