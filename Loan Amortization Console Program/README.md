<h3>
A Terminal-based Loan Amortization Console Program
</h3>
A Terminal-based Loan Amortization Program that I made way back in 18'.

## About the Program
As mentioned, the objective of this program is to create program that imitates how a Loan Amortization plans work and make it into a simple terminal-based program  
wherein User can be the Client or the Lender the main purpose of this program is to learn how real-life problems be solved using software.

Clients should be able to do the ff:
* Create an Account
* Apply for a Loan
* Able to Pay for their Loan
* View the Amortization Table
* Logout

Lenders should be able to the ff:
* Create an Account
* Approve/Decline Client's Loan Application
* View all master list of Client information

This program is probably not the best for beginners due to the nature of the code which is filled with bad practices, however if you still want to learn it, you'll probably learn a thing or two about scoping, reusability, a sprinkle of OOP and data structures especially Linked Lists and its basic operations.

### Built with
